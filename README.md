I'm loading a historical dataset to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. I am using the following algorithms to build my models: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. I'll evaluate model performance by tuning parameter through Grid Search CV. I'll also go through Jaccard index, F1-Score, LogLoss. Final results are shown in final table.
